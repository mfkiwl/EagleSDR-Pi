# EagleSDR-Pi
EagleSDR Pi is a single board SDR platform. It includes a Xilinx Zynq-7020, AD9363/AD9361/AD9364, 512 MByte DDR3L memory, USB OTG port, USB-JTAG/UART port, Ethernet port, 16 MByte Flash memory and MicroSD for configuration and operation. The EagleSDR Pi features the Zynq SoC product from Xilinx, which contains an ARM® Cortex®-A9 core. This makes the EagleSDR Pi extremely flexible, allowing users to take advantage of ARM, and possibly the FPGA fabric as well.

The schematic and PCB are designed by PADS VX 2.7
